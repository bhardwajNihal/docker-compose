# The 'dist' folder is typically generated *inside* the container,
# so you usually don't need to copy your local dist folder.
# However, if you are doing multi-stage builds where a build stage
# outputs to 'dist' and a later stage *copies* from that build stage,
# you might explicitly include `dist` if it's the output of an *earlier* build stage.
# For typical setup where build happens in *single stage*, it's good to exclude:
dist/
build/ # Alternative for build output
